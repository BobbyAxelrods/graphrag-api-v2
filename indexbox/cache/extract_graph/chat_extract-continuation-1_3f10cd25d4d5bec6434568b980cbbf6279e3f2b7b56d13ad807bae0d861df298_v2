Otherwise, the following will apply: \n(a) If more than one of the cancer drug treatments administered in a month have an indication \nother than “for cancer treatment”, only CDL treatments with the indication “for cancer \ntreatment” will be claimable in that month. \n(b) If one or none of the cancer drug treatments administered in a month has an indication other \nthan “for cancer treatment”, all CDL treatments will be claimable in that month. \nTo avoid any doubt, for CDL treatments, the indications refer to the clinical indications of the drug as \nspecified in the CDL on MOH’s website. Non-CDL treatments will be considered as having an \nindication other than “for cancer treatment”. \nFor patients receiving treatment for only one primary cancer, we will pay up to the highest limit \namong the claimable CDL treatments received in that month. \nMultiple Primary Cancers are two or more cancers arising from different sites and/or are of a different \nhistology or morphology group. A patient with cancer that has spread (metastasised) from the place \nwhere it first started to another part of the body will be considered as having a single primary cancer \nas the cancer in the other part of the body started from the original cancer. For example, cancer cells \nmay spread from the breast (primary cancer) to form new tumours in the lung (secondary cancer / \nmetastatic cancer). The new tumour in the lung will not be considered as another primary cancer. \nHigher claim limits for patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers are given on an \napplication basis; doctors are to send the application form to MOH and to us for assessment of \nMediShield Life and PRUShield coverage respectively. \nFor patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers, the maximum claim payable from a \nPRUShield plan for that month will be up to the sum of the highest claim limits among the claimable \nCDL treatments received for each primary cancer in that month. \n4.4.5 What do we pay for Cancer Drug Services? \nWe pay for cancer drug services that are part of a cancer drug treatment (including treatments not on \nthe CDL), such as consultations, scans, laboratory investigations\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CDL TREATMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CDL treatments refer to specific cancer drug treatments that have clinical indications for cancer treatment and are claimable under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MOH refers to the Ministry of Health, which provides guidelines and specifications for cancer drug treatments on its website.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER TREATMENT<|>BENEFIT<|>Cancer treatment refers to medical interventions aimed at treating cancer, which may include various drug treatments and services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTIPLE PRIMARY CANCERS<|>BENEFIT<|>Multiple primary cancers refer to two or more cancers arising from different sites or of different histology, which may have specific claim limits for treatment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRUSHIELD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PRUShield is a health insurance plan that provides coverage for cancer treatments and related services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MediShield Life is a national health insurance scheme that covers basic healthcare needs, including cancer treatments.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOH<|>CDL TREATMENTS<|>MOH specifies the clinical indications for CDL treatments on its website, guiding their claimability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER TREATMENT<|>CDL TREATMENTS<|>CDL treatments are specifically for cancer treatment and are claimable under certain conditions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTIPLE PRIMARY CANCERS<|>CANCER TREATMENT<|>Patients with multiple primary cancers may have different claim limits for cancer treatment<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUSHIELD<|>MULTIPLE PRIMARY CANCERS<|>PRUShield provides coverage for patients receiving treatment for multiple primary cancers<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>MULTIPLE PRIMARY CANCERS<|>MediShield Life covers patients receiving treatment for multiple primary cancers<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
