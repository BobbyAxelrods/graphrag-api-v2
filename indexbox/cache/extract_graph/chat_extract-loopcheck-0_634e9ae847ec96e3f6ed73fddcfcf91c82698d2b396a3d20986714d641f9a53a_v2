Cancer drug treatments not listed or not administered exactly as described in \nthe CDL, are considered non-CDL and will not be claimable under PRUShield, unless otherwise \nstated in this Policy. \nThe CDL currently covers most cancer drug treatments approved by the Health Sciences Authority \n(HSA). The cancer drug treatment claim limit is based on a multiple of the MediShield Life limit for \nthe specific cancer drug treatment. For the latest CDL and MediShield Life limits, refer to the Cancer \nDrug List (CDL) on the MOH’s website. The MOH may update this from time to time. The revised list \nwill be applicable to the Cancer Drug Treatment which occurred on and from the effective date of the \nrevised list. \nFor each primary cancer, if the CDL treatment involves more than one drug, we allow drug omission \nor replacement with another CDL drug with the indication \"for cancer treatment\", only if they are due \nto intolerance or contraindications. In such cases, the claim limit of the original CDL treatment will \napply. \nFor each primary cancer, where multiple cancer drug treatments are administered in a month, if any \nof the CDL treatments have an indication that states “monotherapy”, only CDL treatments with the \nindication “for cancer treatment” will be claimable in that month. Otherwise, the following will apply: \n(a) If more than one of the cancer drug treatments administered in a month have an indication \nother than “for cancer treatment”, only CDL treatments with the indication “for cancer \ntreatment” will be claimable in that month. \n(b) If one\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPROVED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT DRUGS<|>BENEFIT<|>Approved Immunosuppressant Drugs are reimbursed for organ transplant patients as part of outpatient treatment to reduce rejection episodes, under the MediShield Life Scheme and approved by MOH.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER DRUG TREATMENT<|>BENEFIT<|>Cancer drug treatments are reimbursed if they are on the Cancer Drug List (CDL) and administered as specified, with claim limits based on MediShield Life limits.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MediShield Life is a health insurance scheme that provides coverage for various medical treatments, including immunosuppressant drugs and cancer treatments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for approving immunosuppressant drugs and maintaining the Cancer Drug List (CDL).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) approves cancer drug treatments that are included in the Cancer Drug List (CDL).)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPROVED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT DRUGS<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>Approved Immunosuppressant Drugs are covered under the MediShield Life Scheme for organ transplant patients<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER DRUG TREATMENT<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>Cancer Drug Treatments are reimbursed under the MediShield Life scheme if they are on the Cancer Drug List<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOH<|>APPROVED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT DRUGS<|>MOH approves the immunosuppressant drugs that are reimbursed under the MediShield Life Scheme<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOH<|>CANCER DRUG TREATMENT<|>MOH maintains the Cancer Drug List (CDL) which determines the reimbursable cancer drug treatments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY<|>CANCER DRUG TREATMENT<|>The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) approves the cancer drug treatments that are included in the Cancer Drug List (CDL)<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
