This period typically lasts at least 8 hours and can vary depending on the patient's condition and treatment requirements. The term encompasses various scenarios, including admissions for injury, illness, or specific medical testing, such as those related to COVID-19.\n\nDuring Hospital Confinement, the duration of the stay is crucial as it directly impacts the claim amount based on the Policy Year Limit.
