Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Non-CDL treatments will be considered as having an \nindication other than “for cancer treatment”.\nFor patients receiving treatment for only one primary cancer, we will pay up to the highest limit among \nthe claimable CDL treatments received in that month. \nMultiple Primary Cancers are two or more cancers arising from different sites and/or are of a different \nhistology or morphology group. A patient with cancer that has spread (metastasised) from the place \nwhere it first started to another part of the body will be considered as having a single primary cancer \nas the cancer in the other part of the body started from the original cancer. For example, cancer cells \nmay spread from the breast (primary cancer) to form new tumours in the lung (secondary cancer / \nmetastatic cancer). The new tumour in the lung will not be considered as another primary cancer.\nHigher claim limits for patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers are given on an \napplication basis; doctors are to send the application form to MOH and to us for assessment of \nMediShield Life and PRUShield coverage respectively.\nFor patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers, the maximum claim payable from a \nPRUShield plan for that month will be up to the sum of the highest claim limits among the claimable\nCDL treatments received for each primary cancer in that month. \n1.4.5.1.2 What do we pay for Cancer Drug Services?\nWe pay for cancer drug services that are part of a cancer drug treatment (including treatments not on \nthe CDL), such as consultations, scans, laboratory investigations, treatment preparation and \nadministration, supportive care drugs and blood transfusions, up to specified claim limits. Cancer drug \nservices incurred before the cancer is diagnosed, after the cancer has gone into remission, or once \nthe course of treatment has ceased, will not be covered.\nThe Cancer Drug Services claim limit is based on a multiple of the MediShield Life limit for Cancer \nDrug Services. You can find the latest MediShield Life limit for Cancer Drug Services on the MOH’s \nwebsite. The Ministry of Health of Singapore may update this from time to time. The revised limit will \nbe applicable to the\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
