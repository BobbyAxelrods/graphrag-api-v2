Supportive drugs should \nbe claimed under this limit.\nHigher claim limits for patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers are given on an \napplication basis; doctors are to send the application form to MOH and to us for assessment of \nMediShield Life and PRUShield coverage respectively.\nWe will double the claim limit for Cancer Drug Services if the patient had received treatment for Multiple \nPrimary Cancers at any point in time within the same Policy Year. \n1.4.5.2 What do we pay for Outpatient Kidney Failure Treatment?\nWe reimburse you for the Reasonable and Customary Expenses incurred for approved outpatient \nkidney dialysis treatment at MediSave/MediShield Life accredited dialysis treatment centres and the \ncost of the Medically Necessary prescribed erythropoietin for chronic kidney failure. \nWe will not apply a pro-ration factor for outpatient kidney dialysis, if the treatment received by the life \nassured was administered at any of the dialysis centres under the list as shown on our website \n<www.prudential.com.sg>\n1.4.5.3 What do we pay for Immunosuppressants for Organ Transplant?\nWe reimburse you for the cost of the Medically Necessary Immunosuppressants prescribed as a result \nof an organ transplant and as part of the outpatient treatment to reduce the rate of rejection episodes. \nThe Immunosuppressants refer to those approved under the MediShield Life Scheme and by MOH as \nthe immunosuppressants for organ transplant.\n1.4.5.4 Long-Term Parenteral Nutrition \nWe reimburse the Reasonable and Customary expenses incurred for Long-Term Parenteral Nutrition. \nThis includes the"

Any claims incurred after this expiry or termination date \nwill not be valid. This includes any claims incurred during the 60-day period.\nWe will refund the pro-rated premiums, regardless of any payout during the Policy Year. \nExcept in the situation where the life assured dies, if your policy terminates before the next Premium \nDue Date, and no claim has been paid during that Policy Year, we will refund the pro-rated premium \nbased on the number of unused days for the rest of that Policy Year, to the MediSave account. \nIf you pay part of your premium in cash, then the amounts we refund will be proportionate to the \namount we deduct from the MediSave account and the amount we collect from you in cash.\nExample\nIf your premium is made up of 80% from the MediSave account and you pay the remainder of 20% \nin cash, then the refund of unused premium will be in the same proportion – meaning 80% returned \nto the MediSave account and 20% paid to you. We or the CPF Board (as the case may be) will determine the effective date of termination of your \npolicy.\nIn the event of such termination"

Otherwise, the following will apply:\n(a) If more than one of the cancer drug treatments administered in a month have an indication other \nthan “for cancer treatment”, only CDL treatments with the indication “for cancer treatment” will be \nclaimable in that month.\n(b) If one or none of the cancer drug treatments administered in a month has an indication other than \n“for cancer treatment”, all CDL treatments will be claimable in that month.\nTo avoid any doubt, for CDL treatments, the indications refer to the clinical indications of the drug as \nspecified in the CDL on MOH’s website.

This includes any claims incurred during the 60-day period.\nWe will refund the pro-rated premiums, regardless of any payout during the Policy Year. \nExcept in the situation where the life assured dies, if your policy terminates before the next Premium \nDue Date, and no claim has been paid during that Policy Year, we will refund the pro-rated premium \nbased on the number of unused days for the rest of that Policy Year, to the MediSave account. \nIf you pay part of your premium in cash, then the amounts we refund will be proportionate to the \namount we deduct from the MediSave account and the amount we collect from you in cash.\nExample\nIf your premium is made up of 80% from the MediSave account and you pay the remainder of 20% in \ncash, then the refund of unused premium will be in the same proportion – meaning 80% returned to \nthe MediSave account and 20% paid to you. \nWe or the CPF Board (as the case may be) will determine the effective date of termination of your \npolicy.\nIn the event of such termination, you shall have no further claims or rights against us under your policy, \nexcept as specifically stated otherwise in this Policy document.\nTo avoid any doubt, the termination of your Policy by you or us shall not affect the insurance coverage \nunder MediShield Life. The life assured will continue to be insured under the MediShield Life Scheme \nwith the CPF Board as long as the life assured is eligible for the scheme. \n2.9.8 Reinstatement of your Policy \nYou may apply to reinstate your policy if: \n- you pay all the required premiums; and\n- you give us satisfactory evidence of the health of the life assured. You must pay for the costs \ninvolved in this. \nWe will not cover any claim incurred before the effective date of the reinstatement of the policy, unless \nthe claim was declared in the reinstatement form and specifically accepted by us.\nTo apply you must use our appropriate application form and meet the conditions on it. We will notify \nyou if we accept your application.\n\n2.9.9 Change of citizenship, residency status or occupation for Foreigners \nYou must inform us as soon as possible"

Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.
