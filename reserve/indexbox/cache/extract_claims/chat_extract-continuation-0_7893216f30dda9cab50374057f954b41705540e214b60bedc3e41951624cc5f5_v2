Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Cancer drug treatments not listed or not administered exactly as described in the CDL, \nare considered non-CDL and will not be claimable under PRUShield, unless otherwise stated in this \nPolicy. \nThe CDL currently covers most cancer drug treatments approved by the Health Sciences Authority \n(HSA). The cancer drug treatment claim limit is based on a multiple of the MediShield Life limit for the \nspecific cancer drug treatment. For the latest CDL and MediShield Life limits, refer to the Cancer Drug \nList (CDL) on the MOH’s website. The MOH may update this from time to time. The revised list will be \napplicable to the Cancer Drug Treatment which occurred on and from the effective date of the revised \nlist.\nFor each primary cancer, if the CDL treatment involves more than one drug, we allow drug omission \nor replacement with another CDL drug with the indication \"for cancer treatment\", only if they are due \nto intolerance or contraindications. In such cases, the claim limit of the original CDL treatment will \napply.\nFor each primary cancer, where multiple cancer drug treatments are administered in a month, if any \nof the CDL treatments have an indication that states “monotherapy”, only CDL treatments with the \nindication “for cancer treatment” will be claimable in that month. Otherwise, the following will apply:\n(a) If more than one of the cancer drug treatments administered in a month have an indication \nother than “for cancer treatment”, only CDL treatments with the indication “for cancer \ntreatment” will be claimable in that month.\n(b) If one or none of the cancer drug treatments administered in a month has an indication other \nthan “for cancer treatment”, all CDL treatments will be claimable in that month.\nTo avoid any doubt, for CDL treatments, the indications refer to the clinical indications of the drug as \nspecified in the CDL on MOH’s website. Non-CDL treatments will be considered as having an \nindication other than “for cancer treatment”.\nFor patients receiving treatment for only one primary cancer, we will pay up to the highest limit among \nthe claimable CDL treatments received in that month. \nMultiple Primary\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY<|>NONE<|>CANCER DRUG TREATMENT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) approves most cancer drug treatments that are covered under the Cancer Drug List (CDL)<|>The CDL currently covers most cancer drug treatments approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).)\n##\n(MINISTRY OF HEALTH<|>NONE<|>CANCER DRUG TREATMENT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Ministry of Health (MOH) may update the Cancer Drug List (CDL) from time to time, and the revised list will be applicable to treatments occurring from the effective date of the revised list.<|>The MOH may update this from time to time.
