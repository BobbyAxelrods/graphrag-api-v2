Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

You can find the latest MediShield Life limit for Cancer Drug Services on the MOHâ€™s \nwebsite. The Ministry of Health of Singapore may update this from time to time. The revised limit will \nbe applicable to the Cancer Drug Services incurred within the Policy Year of the revised limit.\nThis limit does not only apply to services related to cancer drug treatments on the CDL, meaning we \nwill also pay even if the service was for a non-CDL cancer drug treatment. Supportive drugs should \nbe claimed under this limit.\nHigher claim limits for patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers are given on an \napplication basis; doctors are to send the application form to MOH and to us for assessment of \nMediShield Life and PRUShield coverage respectively.\nWe will double the claim limit for Cancer Drug Services if the patient had received treatment for Multiple \nPrimary Cancers at any point in time within the same Policy Year. \n1.4.5.2 What do we pay for Outpatient Kidney Failure Treatment?\nWe reimburse you for the Reasonable and Customary Expenses incurred for approved outpatient \nkidney dialysis treatment at MediSave/MediShield Life accredited dialysis treatment centres and the \ncost of the Medically Necessary prescribed erythropoietin for chronic kidney failure. \nWe will not apply a pro-ration factor for outpatient kidney dialysis, if the treatment received by the life \nassured was administered at any of the dialysis centres under the list as shown on our website \n<www.prudential.com.sg>\n1.4.5.3 What do we pay for Immunosuppressants for Organ Transplant?\nWe reimburse you for the cost of the Medically Necessary Immunosuppressants prescribed as a result \nof an organ transplant and as part of the outpatient treatment to reduce the rate of rejection episodes. \nThe Immunosuppressants refer to those approved under the MediShield Life Scheme and by MOH as \nthe immunosuppressants for organ transplant.\n1.4.5.4 Long-Term Parenteral Nutrition \nWe reimburse the Reasonable and Customary expenses incurred for Long-Term Parenteral Nutrition. \nThis includes the\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
