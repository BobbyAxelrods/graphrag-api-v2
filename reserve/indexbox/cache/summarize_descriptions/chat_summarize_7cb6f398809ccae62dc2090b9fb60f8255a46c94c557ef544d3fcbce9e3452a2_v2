This designation applies particularly to those who have traveled out of Singapore against official travel advisories and exhibit symptoms of COVID-19. The term encompasses individuals who, due to underlying health conditions or other factors, are at a heightened risk of severe illness from the virus. Consequently, at-risk travelers may encounter challenges in securing adequate health insurance coverage, as many policies have specific exclusions related to COVID-19 treatment.
