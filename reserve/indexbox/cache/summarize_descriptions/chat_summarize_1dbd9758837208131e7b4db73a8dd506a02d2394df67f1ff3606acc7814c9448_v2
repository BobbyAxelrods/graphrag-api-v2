It is typically expressed as a percentage of the total costs of covered healthcare services. Once the deductible is satisfied, the insured individual is responsible for paying this specified percentage of the costs associated with their medical care.\n\nIn essence, co-insurance represents the shared financial responsibility between the insurer and the insured. For example, if a health insurance policy stipulates a co-insurance rate of 20%, the insured will pay 20% of the costs for covered services, while the insurance company will cover the remaining 80%. This arrangement applies to various benefits outlined in the insurance policy, ensuring that the insured contributes to their healthcare expenses even after the deductible has been met.\n\nOverall, co-insurance is a critical component of many health insurance plans, as it helps to define the financial obligations of the insured in relation to their healthcare services.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1746506047, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0392822090", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
