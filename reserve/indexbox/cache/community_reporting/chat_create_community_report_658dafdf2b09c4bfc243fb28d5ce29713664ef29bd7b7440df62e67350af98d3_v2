This reinforces the idea that the Deductible is a prerequisite for the insurer to commence payment for claims, ensuring that the insured has a stake in the initial costs associated with their coverage.\n\nOverall, the Deductible serves as a mechanism to share the financial burden between the insurer and the insured, requiring the latter to contribute a specified amount before the insurance coverage is activated for claims or benefits.\",5\r\n20,CLAUSE 4,Clause 4 of the Policy Booklet provides detailed explanations of the benefits mentioned.,3\r\n71,TREATMENT-SPECIFIC CLAIM LIMITS,Treatment-specific claim limits refer to the maximum amount that can be claimed for specific cancer drug treatments as outlined in the policy.,1\r\n72,MULTIPLE CANCER DRUG TREATMENTS,The administration of multiple cancer drug treatments in a month is an event that affects claimability under the policy based on specific conditions.,1\r\n73,EFFECTIVE DATE,The effective date refers to the date from which the revised Cancer Drug List (CDL) and its limits apply to treatments.,1\r\n76,CLAIM LIMIT,\"The term \"\"claim limit\"\" pertains to the maximum amount that can be claimed under a health insurance policy for specific treatments.
