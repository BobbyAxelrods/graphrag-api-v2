This period is essential for determining premium refunds, processing claims, and calculating insurance benefits. During the Policy Year, the insurance coverage remains active, allowing policyholders to access their benefits as stipulated in their agreements.\n\nThe Policy Year serves as a framework within which all insurance-related activities occur. It is the timeframe that insurers use to evaluate the performance of the policy, assess claims made by policyholders, and determine any applicable refunds on premiums.

This suggests that the Review Period may encompass various types of insurance, including health-related coverage, allowing policyholders to consider the adequacy and suitability of their insurance in relation to their needs.\n\nDuring the Review Period, the policyholder has the right to cancel the policy, provided they submit a written notice within this specified timeframe. This cancellation option is a critical aspect of the Review Period, as it empowers the policyholder to withdraw from the policy without facing penalties, as long as they adhere to the stipulated conditions.\n\nIn summary, the Review Period is a defined duration that enables policyholders to evaluate their insurance policies, particularly in the context of medical services, and to cancel their policies with written notice if they choose to do so.\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n67,POLICY YEAR,BENEFITS SCHEDULE,The Benefits Schedule is updated annually based on the Policy Year,19\r\n207,REVIEW PERIOD,POLICY YEAR,\"The Review Period is part of the Policy Year, allowing policyholders to evaluate their insurance options\",8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
