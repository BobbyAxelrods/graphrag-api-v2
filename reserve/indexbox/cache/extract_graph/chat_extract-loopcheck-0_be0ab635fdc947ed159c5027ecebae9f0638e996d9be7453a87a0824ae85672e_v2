Cancer \ndrug services incurred before the cancer is diagnosed, after the cancer has gone into remission, or \nonce the course of treatment has ceased, will not be covered. \nThe Cancer Drug Services claim limit is based on a multiple of the MediShield Life limit for Cancer \nDrug Services. You can find the latest MediShield Life limit for Cancer Drug Services on the MOHâ€™s \nwebsite. The Ministry of Health of Singapore may update this from time to time. The revised limit will \nbe applicable to the Cancer Drug Services incurred within the Policy Year of the revised limit. \nThis limit does not only apply to services related to cancer drug treatments on the CDL, meaning we \nwill also pay even if the service was for a non-CDL cancer drug treatment. Supportive drugs should \nbe claimed under this limit.\n\n\nHigher claim limits for patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers are given on an \napplication basis; doctors are to send the application form to MOH and to us for assessment of \nMediShield Life and PRUShield coverage respectively. \nWe will double the claim limit for Cancer Drug Services if the patient had received treatment for \nMultiple Primary Cancers at any point in time within the same Policy Year. \n4.5 Other benefits \n4.5.1 What do we pay for Final Expense Provision? \nIf the life assured dies during hospitalisation or within 30 days of discharge from the Hospital as a result \nof the cause of the hospitalisation, we will waive the Deductible and Co-insurance amounts up to \nmaximum limits of the Final Expense Provision benefit for your type of plan as set out in the Benefits \nSchedule above. \nFor an illustration of the detailed calculation of claims under this benefit, please refer to Clause 11.3 on \npage 17 of this Policy Booklet. \n4.5.2 What\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PRUSHIELD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PRUShield is a health insurance plan that provides coverage for patients receiving treatment for Multiple Primary Cancers, including various cancer drug services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER DRUG SERVICES<|>BENEFIT<|>Cancer Drug Services include consultations, scans, laboratory investigations, treatment preparation and administration, supportive care drugs, and blood transfusions related to cancer treatment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF SINGAPORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ministry of Health of Singapore oversees health policies and may update claim limits for Cancer Drug Services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>BENEFIT<|>MediShield Life is a health insurance scheme that provides coverage for hospital bills and certain outpatient treatments, including cancer drug services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINAL EXPENSE PROVISION<|>BENEFIT<|>Final Expense Provision is a benefit that waives Deductible and Co-insurance amounts if the life assured dies during hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICY YEAR<|>DATE<|>The Policy Year refers to the annual period during which the insurance coverage is active and benefits are assessed.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUSHIELD<|>CANCER DRUG SERVICES<|>PRUShield provides coverage for Cancer Drug Services for patients with Multiple Primary Cancers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF SINGAPORE<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>The Ministry of Health of Singapore updates the limits for MediShield Life, which includes coverage for Cancer Drug Services<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUSHIELD<|>MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF SINGAPORE<|>PRUShield's claim limits for Cancer Drug Services may be updated by the Ministry of Health of Singapore<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINAL EXPENSE PROVISION<|>PRUSHIELD<|>Final Expense Provision is a benefit included in the PRUShield plan that waives certain costs upon the death of the life assured<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDISHIELD LIFE<|>CANCER DRUG SERVICES<|>MediShield Life provides coverage for Cancer Drug Services as part of its health insurance scheme<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER DRUG SERVICES<|>FINAL EXPENSE PROVISION<|>Both Cancer Drug Services and Final Expense Provision are benefits associated with health insurance plans<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
